					Why do we need Metamask? Well. We need to be able to call
					functions on our smart contract that live on the blockchain.
					And, to do that we need to have a wallet that has our
					Ethereum address and private key. But, we need something to
					connect our website with our wallet so we can securely pass
					our wallet credentials to our website so our website can use
					those credentials to call our smart contract. You need to
					have valid credentials to access functions on smart
					contracts. It's almost like authentication. We need
					something to "login" to the blockchain and then use those
					login credentials to make API requests from our website.
